What is the services/* directory?

-> Itâ€™s a folder used to contain business logic
-> Think of it as a "middleman" layer between your components (views) and your backend or APIs
-> Your services should import utility/axiosInstance.js to connect to your backend. 
-> Your views should import services/xxx.js to use the services and your views should not need to import utility/axiosInstance.js anymore  

What services we have?
-> OrderFoodService
-> RunnerFoodService
