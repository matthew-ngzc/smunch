# SMUNCH

**SMUNCH** is a web application designed for students at Singapore Management University (SMU) to solve a common issue: getting food conveniently between or during classes. By connecting students with peers acting as food runners, SMUNCH enables grouped food ordering based on class schedule and delivery directly within SMU buildings.

## Overview

SMUNCH is a student-driven platform that facilitates group food ordering within SMU. The platform groups students by class schedule (e.g., Section G4 - 8:15 AM Friday) and matches these orders with available student food runners. This solves the problem of short class breaks and limited delivery access on campus, while offering a flexible income opportunity for students.

## Objectives

- Simplify and automate class-based food ordering  
- Allow students to get meals without leaving campus  
- Enable student delivery runners to earn flexibly  
- Create a closed-loop campus food delivery ecosystem

## Key Features

- Class-Based Group Ordering  
- Merchant and Menu Browsing  
- Post, Update, Retrieve and Delete Orders  
- Dynamic Delivery Fee Sharing  
- Runner Job Matching  
- Real-Time Order Status Tracking  
- Payment and Transaction History  
- Auto-Cancellation Notifications if No Runner Found
